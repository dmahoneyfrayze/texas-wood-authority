# Texas Pecan: The Understated Giant of Live Edge

If Parota is the "king of size" and Walnut is the "king of luxury," then **Pecan** is the champion of Texas character. 

As the state tree of Texas, Pecan is more than just a source of nuts—it's one of the hardest and most beautiful woods available for large-format furniture in the Lone Star State.

## Why We Love Texas Pecan

### 1. Incredible Hardness
Pecan is a member of the Hickory family. On the Janka hardness scale, it ranks significantly higher than Black Walnut (1820 vs 1010). This makes it virtually "kid-proof" and "party-proof." It resists dents and scratches better than almost any other commercial hardwood.

### 2. High-Contrast Heart/Sapwood
Similar to Parota, Pecan features a dramatic contrast between its dark heartwood and creamy sapwood. However, Pecan often has "calico" patterns—swirling mixes of brown, gray, and tan that are entirely unique to each tree.

### 3. "Spalting" Graphics
Native Texas Pecan is prone to "spalting"—a natural fungal process that creates black, ink-like lines through the grain. These lines are purely aesthetic and don't compromise structural integrity when properly stabilized/finished, but they add a level of artistic flair that is hard to find in other species.

## The Challenges of Pecan

### The Drying Nightmare
You cannot treat Pecan like other woods. It has a mind of its own during the drying process. 
*   **Warping**: Because it is so dense, Pecan wants to twist and bow as it loses water.
*   **The Fix**: It requires a very slow, controlled kiln schedule. At Kovara, we ensure our Pecan has spent the appropriate time in the kiln to "tame" the tension before we ever touch it with a sander.

## Design Tips for Pecan Tables
Pecan looks best when paired with **minimalist bases**. Because the grain is so "busy" and colorful, you don't want a complex base fighting for attention. Simple black steel U-legs or a sleek T-base allows the wood to be the star.
