# Finding Your Shape: Slab Profiles & Space Planning

Selecting a live edge slab isn't just about the species; it's about the **silhouette**. The shape of your slab determines how traffic flows through your room, how many guests you can comfortably seat, and the overall "vibe" of your design.

## 1. The Natural Live Edge (Organic Profile)
This is the classic look where both long edges retain the natural contour of the tree.
*   **Best For**: Large, open dining rooms where the table is the hero.
*   **Character**: High. Great for showcasing the tree's history.
*   **Planning Tip**: Remember that "width" will vary. A slab that is 40" wide at the ends might pinch down to 34" in the center. Always plan for the **minimum width** when thinking about place settings.

## 2. The Straight-Cut Live Edge (The Hybrid)
In this style, one long edge is cut perfectly straight and the other is left natural.
*   **Best For**: Desks pushed against a wall, or smaller dining rooms where you need to save space on one side.
*   **Character**: Modern and intentional.
*   **Planning Tip**: Place the straight edge against the wall or high-traffic area to prevent "hip-bumps" against irregular natural edges.

## 3. The "River" Profile (Inward Live Edge)
Two live edge slabs are flipped so the natural edges face each other, usually filled with epoxy or glass.
*   **Best For**: Conversation pieces and modern "Monolith" designs.
*   **Character**: Highly artistic and customizable.
*   **Planning Tip**: River tables allow for perfectly straight outer edges while keeping the "live" energy in the center of the table.

## Shape vs. Guest Count

When planning your space, use the following rules of thumb for comfort:

| Slab Shape | Best Guest Arrangement | Space Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rectangular / Slab** | Traditional seating on both sides. | Allow 36" of clearance behind chairs. |
| **Oval / Tapered** | Great for "rounding" the ends for extra guests. | Better flow in narrow rooms. |
| **Round (Cookie)** | Perfect for intimate 4-6 person dining. | Requires a centralized pedestal base. |

## Matching Shape to Room Flow

*   **Traffic Lanes**: If your table sits in a walkway, choose a slab with a "milder" live edge profile. Sharp protrusions can be dangerous in tight spaces.
*   **Lighting**: Position the table so that overhead lighting spans the **length** of the slab to highlight the grain flow.
*   **The Waterfall Factor**: If you are using a [Waterfall Joint](/guides/the-waterfall-edge-mastering-grain-flow), the vertical leg will block chair entry on that side. Plan accordingly!

## Conclusion: Trust Your Instinct
While the math matters, live edge is an emotional purchase. If you find a slab with a "crazy" shape that you love, a custom builder can usually find a creative base design to make it work in your home.
