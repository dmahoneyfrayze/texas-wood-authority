# The Informed Buyer: 7 Questions to Ask Your Live Edge Maker

A live edge table is a significant investment. It is part furniture, part sculpture, and part heirloom. However, the market is flooded with "hobbyist" makers who may not understand the science of wood.

To ensure you are buying a piece that will last for generations, ask these seven questions before you sign a contract.

## 1. Was this wood kiln-dried, and to what moisture content?
*   **The Right Answer**: "Yes, it was kiln-dried to 6-8% moisture content."
*   **The Red Flag**: "It's been air-drying in my barn for 5 years." Air-dried wood is rarely dry enough for a climate-controlled home and is highly likely to warp.

## 2. Is this a "Single Slab" or a "Glue-up"?
*   **Definition**: A single slab is one solid piece from a tree. A glue-up is multiple boards joined together.
*   **Premium Choice**: Single slabs are more rare and more valuable, especially in widths over 36". **Parota** is famous for offering massive single-slab options that species like Walnut rarely can.

## 3. How do you reinforce natural cracks and voids?
*   **The Right Answer**: "We use butterfly (bowtie) joinery for structural stability and premium deep-pour epoxy for aesthetics."
*   **The Red Flag**: "We just fill it with sawdust and glue." This will eventually fail as the wood moves.

## 4. What type of finish do you use?
*   **Common Choices**: Rubio Monocoat (High-end oil), Ceramic Coatings, or Professional Spray Lacquer.
*   **Expert Tip**: Ask how the finish handles **liquid spills** (red wine, water rings) and if the finish can be **easily repaired** at home if it gets scratched.

## 5. How are the legs attached to allow for wood movement?
*   **The Right Answer**: "We use threaded inserts and slotted holes in the leg plates."
*   **The Red Flag**: "We just screw them straight into the wood." If the wood can't expand and contract, it will eventually split.

## 6. What is the species and where was it sourced?
*   **Why it Matters**: Sustainable sourcing is critical. Species like Parota from Mexico/Costa Rica are fast-growing and sustainable, whereas old-growth species may be ethically questionable.

## 7. Can I see the actual slab before you finish it?
*   **The Maker's Standard**: A professional will allow you to see (via photo or in-person) the raw slab to approve the grain pattern, knots, and edge profile before they begin the irreversible finishing process.
