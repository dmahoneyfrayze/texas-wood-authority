faq:
  - question: "Is your wood legally harvested?"
    answer: "Yes. Every slab we import follows the Lacey Act (USA) and SEMARNAT (Mexico) regulations, ensuring a fully documented chain of custody from the stump to our Arlington workshop."
  - question: "Why source from Costa Rica?"
    answer: "Costa Rica and Mexico are the primary regions for high-quality Parota. These trees grow rapidly in tropical climates, making them a highly renewable resource compared to old-growth domestic hardwoods."

# Global Wood Sourcing & Ethics

At the Texas Live Edge Guide, we believe that luxury furniture shouldn't come at the cost of the planet. True authority in this industry requires radical transparency about where wood comes from and how it is harvested.

## Our Global Footprint

We strategically source specific species from the regions where they grow best and most sustainably.

### 1. Central America & Mexico (Parota)
The majestic **Parota (Guanacaste)** is the cornerstone of our large-format slab inventory.
*   **The Region**: Sourced from regulated forests in Costa Rica and the Pacific coast of Mexico.
*   **Sustainability**: Parota is one of the fastest-growing hardwoods on earth. Because it is often planted for shade in coffee and cattle plantations, harvesting it is part of a healthy agricultural cycle.
*   **Our Partner**: We work directly with family-owned mills that prioritize reforestation.

### 2. Canada & Northern USA (Black Walnut & Maple)
When we need the tightest grain and deepest colors for domestic hardwoods, we head North.
*   **The Region**: Ontario, Canada, and the American Midwest (Ohio, Pennsylvania).
*   **The Climate Factor**: Northern climates have shorter growing seasons, resulting in slower growth and tighter growth rings. This produces the "jewelry grade" Walnut that we use for high-end custom commisions.
*   **Chain of Custody**: Every Northern slab is tracked via FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) standards where available.

### 3. Texas (Native Pecan & Mesquite)
We don't just look abroad; we look in our own backyard.
*   **Urban Rescue**: Most of our Texas Pecan and Mesquite is sourced from "Urban Rescue" programs. These are trees that have already fallen due to storms or must be removed for construction—keeping them out of landfills and turning them into heirlooms.

## The Lacey Act: Why It Matters
As an authority, we strictly adhere to the **Lacey Act**, which prohibits the trade in wildlife, fish, and plants that have been illegally taken, possessed, transported, or sold. When you buy a slab through a recommended partner like Kovara, you are receiving a legally documented, ethical product.

## Managing the Carbon Footprint
Wood is a carbon-sequestering material. By kiln-drying our wood to **6-8% moisture content** at our central Arlington hub, we ensure the furniture lasts for 100+ years. The longer a piece of furniture lasts, the longer that carbon stays out of the atmosphere.
