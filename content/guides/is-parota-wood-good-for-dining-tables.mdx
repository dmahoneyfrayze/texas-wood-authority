faq:
  - question: "Does Parota wood scratch easily?"
    answer: "Parota is softer than red oak, so it can dent or scratch if not finished properly. We recommend a high-quality ceramic nano-coating or hardwax oil to increase surface durability."
  - question: "Is Parota water resistant?"
    answer: "Yes, Parota is naturally water-resistant due to its tropical origins, making it less prone to localized swelling from spills compared to domestic softwoods."

# Is Parota Wood Good for Dining Tables?

One of the most common questions we get is: "I love the look of that massive slab, but is it going to last?" 

The short answer is **yes**. Parota (also known as Guanacaste) is arguably the *best* wood species available today for large-format live edge dining tables. Here is why.

## 1. Size Matters for Dining

Most domestic hardwoods (like Walnut or Oak) rarely grow large enough to create a 40-50 inch wide single slab. To make a table that wide, you usually have to glue two or three boards together (a "bookmatch" or "glue-up").

**Parota plays by different rules.** The trees are massive.
*   **Single Slabs**: It is common to find single Parota slabs that are 4, 5, or even 6 feet wide.
*   **The Look**: This means your dining table is one seamless, continuous canvas of nature. No glue lines. No color matching issues. Just one giant tree trunk.

## 2. Stability in Temperamental Climates

Wood moves. It expands in summer humidity and contracts in winter dryness.
Parota has an "interlocking grain" structure that makes it incredibly stable once kiln-dried. It is less likely to split or check (crack) than denser woods like White Oak when subjected to HVAC fluctuations.

## 3. The "Warmth" Factor

Dining rooms are gathering spaces. You want warmth.
Parota has a reddish-amber heartwood that glows under warm dining room lighting. The creamy sapwood on the live edges frames the table, making it pop against dark floors or rugs.

## The One Drawback (And How to Fix It)

Parota is lighter and slightly softer than Black Walnut.
*   **Risk**: If your kid drags a metal toy car across it with full force, it will dent.
*   **Fix**: This is entirely dependent on the **finish**. A raw Parota table is vulnerable. A Parota table finished with a high-grade **ceramic-fortified finish** or deeper penetrating **hardwax oil** becomes a daily driver capable of handling family life.
