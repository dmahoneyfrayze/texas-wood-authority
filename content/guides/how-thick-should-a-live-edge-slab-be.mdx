# How Thick Should a Live Edge Slab Be?

When shopping for a slab, you'll see thicknesses ranging from a skinny 1 inch to a chunky 4 inches. What is the sweet spot?

## The Gold Standard: 2 to 2.25 Inches

For **dining tables**, **desks**, and **conference tables**, the industry standard is **2 inches (approx 50mm)**.
*   **Aesthetics**: It looks substantial and expensive without looking like a butcher block.
*   **Weight**: Manageable. A 2" slab is heavy but movable. A 3" slab requires a forklift.
*   **Hardware**: Standard legs and threaded inserts are designed for 1.5" to 2" depth.

## When to Go Thicker (3"+)

*   **Coffee Tables**: Since they are low to the ground, a chunky slab makes a bold statement.
*   **Mantels**: A fireplace mantel often needs visual weight to balance the stone or brick.
*   **Commercial Bars**: High-traffic areas often benefit from the "bulletproof" look of a 3-inch slab.

## When to Go Thinner (1.5")

*   **Consoles**: A hallway table doesn't need to support 200lbs of Thanksgiving dinner.
*   **Floating Shelves**: Weight is the enemy of floating shelving hardware. Thinner is better.

> [!TIP]
> **Warning**: Avoid live edge slabs thinner than 1.5" for dining tables. They are prone to warping and often feel "cheap" to the touch compared to a solid 2" heirloom piece.

## Measuring Thickness vs. Flatness

Remember: You lose thickness during flattening.
If you buy a raw 2" slab, by the time it is flattened on the CNC and sanded, it might be 1.75".
*   **Buy thicker than you need.** If you want a finished 2" table, look for a 2.25" or 2.5" raw slab.
