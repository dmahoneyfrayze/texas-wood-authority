# The Ultimate Guide to Parota Wood

Parota (*Enterolobium cyclocarpum*), also known as Guanacaste or Rain Tree, is one of the most sought-after exotic hardwoods for live edge furniture. Native to Mexico and Central America, this wood is prized for its massive size, striking grain patterns, and sustainable abundance.

## Why Choose Parota?

Unlike slow-growing hardwoods like Walnut or Oak, Parota is a fast-growing species. This makes it a **sustainable choice** for large furniture projects.

### Key Characteristics

- **Size**: Parota trees can reach enormous diameters, allowing for single-slab dining tables up to 60" wide.
- **Grain**: Two-tone coloring with a creamy sapwood and rich amber-brown heartwood.
- **Durability**: Naturally resistant to decay and insects.

> [!TIP]
> Because Parota grows so fast, it is lighter than Oak but still incredibly stable when kiln-dried properly.

## Kiln Drying is Non-Negotiable

For any live edge slab, proper drying is essential. At Kovara, we ensure all our Parota slabs are kiln-dried to 6-8% moisture content to prevent warping or cracking in your home.
