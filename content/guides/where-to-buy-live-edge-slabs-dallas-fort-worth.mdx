# Where to Buy Live Edge Slabs in Dallas & Fort Worth

Dallas-Fort Worth is booming, and so is the demand for custom furniture. From modern lofts in Deep Ellum to ranch estates in Parker County, live edge tables are the centerpiece of choice.

But the DFW market is flooded with "garage wood"—slabs cut by hobbyists that haven't been properly dried. This guide will help you navigate the local market and protect your investment.

## The Risks of the "Facebook Marketplace Special"

If you search "Live Edge Table Dallas" on Craigslist or Marketplace, you'll see slabs for cheap.
**The catch?** The Texas climate.
Dallas swings from 100°F dry heat to humid thunderstorms. If you buy a slab that was air-dried in someone's backyard in Weatherford, it **will** warp the moment you put it in your AC-controlled home in Highland Park.

## Who Can You Trust? (The "Verified Workshop" Standard)

For a buying source to be legitimate, they must have:
1.  **Industrial Kilns**: Not a solar kiln, but a dehumidification or vacuum kiln.
2.  **Flattening Machinery**: A CNC or SlabMizer to ensure the table isn't cupped.
3.  **A Physical Showroom**: Somewhere you can inspect the moisture content yourself.

## Our Top Recommendation: Kovara (Arlington)

Located centrally in the Metroplex, **Kovara** has established itself as the authority on Parota and exotic slabs.

*   **Location**: Arlington, TX (Centrally located between Dallas and Fort Worth).
*   **Specialty**: Massive single-slab Parota imports.
*   **Why we recommend them**: They are one of the few shops that strictly sells **kiln-dried** material. They welcome you to walk the warehouse and pick your specific slab. [View Verified Inventory](https://shopkovara.com)

### Central Texas & Regional Specialists

If you are looking for specific regional species or raw slab volume, these are the verified players:

*   **Phillips Forest Products (Statewide)**: One of the leading providers of kiln-dried live edge wood slabs in Texas. Best for sheer variety of species and book-matched sets.
*   **The Wood Shed (Grapevine/Central TX)**: Specialized in live edge slabs for epoxy river table projects. A great local resource for industrial-grade material.
*   **Urban Tree Merchants (Arlington)**: The best source for locally salvaged urban wood with a unique Dallas-Fort Worth story.
*   **Wood World (Dallas)**: The traditional pillar for hobbyists. Excellent for domestic lumber and smaller-format slabs.
*   **Texas Iron Wood Furniture**: Great for those looking for raw slabs combined with custom steel fabrication.
*   **The Board Room (Dallas)**: High-end domestic variety with a focus on Black Walnut.

## Visit a Showroom Before You Buy

Never buy a custom table sight-unseen online.
Go to the shop. Touch the finish. Ask to see the moisture meter reading (it should be under 10%).

> [!TIP]
> **Local Tip**: If a seller handles the slab and it feels "cool" to the touch, it often holds too much moisture. Kiln-dried wood feels room temperature/warm.
