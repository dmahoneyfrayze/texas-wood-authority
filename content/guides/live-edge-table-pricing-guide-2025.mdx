# Live Edge Table Pricing Guide (2025 Update)

"How much does it cost?"
It's the hardest question to answer because no two trees are alike. However, in the 2024-2025 market, there are clear price brackets you should expect.

## The "Danger Zone": Under $2,500
If you see a completed 8-foot dining table for $1,500 on Facebook Marketplace, **run**.
*   **Why?**: Identifying logs, milling them, and [kiln-drying them](/process/how-live-edge-tables-are-made) takes months of labor and expensive equipment.
*   **The Math**: A proper kiln-dried raw slab alone often costs $1,500 wholesale. If the finished table is that cheap, they cut corners on drying. You are buying a future warped potato chip. (Read more on **[Why Wood Warps](/care/does-live-edge-furniture-warp)**).

## The "Standard Range": $3,500 - $6,500
This is the sweet spot for high-quality, long-lasting furniture.
*   **Wood Options**: Parota, Maple, respectable Walnut pieces.
*   **Finish**: Professional spray finish or high-end Hardwax Oil (Rubio Monocoat).
*   **Base**: Powder-coated steel legs (U-legs, X-legs).

## The "Premium Tier": $7,000 - $15,000+
*   **Wood Options**: Highly figured Black Walnut, Bastogne Walnut, or massive single-slab rarities (60"+ wide).
*   **Base**: Custom fabricated metal or wood bases.
*   **Epoxy**: "River tables" often land in this bracket due to the high cost of epoxy resin and labor.

## Cost Breakdown by Species (Estimates for 8' Table)

| Wood Species | Estimated Price Range | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Parota (Guanacaste)](/guides/parota-wood-pros-cons-use-cases)** | $3,500 - $5,500 | Best value for size. Massive width, reasonable price. |
| **Black Walnut** | $6,000 - $10,000 | The gold standard. Dark, rich, holds value. |
| **White Oak** | $4,500 - $7,000 | Very trendy, hard to find in wide slabs. |
| **Pecan / Mesquite** | $4,000 - $6,500 | Very localized (Texas), lots of character/holes to fill. |

## Hidden Costs to Watch For
1.  **Shipping**: Freight for a 400lb crate can run $500-$1,000. *Buying local in DFW saves this cost.*
2.  **White Glove Delivery**: Do you have 4 friends to help lift it? If not, pay the $300 for setup.
