# Custom vs. Pre-made Live Edge Tables

You are ready to buy. Do you walk into a showroom and point at "Table #4," or do you start a custom build?

## Option 1: Pre-Made (Ready to Ship)

**Pros:**
*   **Instant Gratification**: You see exactly what you are getting. You can touch the finish, see the grain, and measure the exact dimensions.
*   **No Surprises**: Nature is unpredictable. With a finished table, there is no guessing how the color will turn out.
*   **Speed**: delivery in 1-2 weeks.

**Cons:**
*   **Compromise**: Maybe you love the wood but hate the legs. Or it's 6 inches too short for your room.

## Option 2: Custom Commission

**Pros:**
*   **Perfect Fit**: You specify the exact length (e.g., 108 inches) to fit your rug.
*   **Slab Selection**: You get to pick the specific raw slab. "I want the one with the crazy knot on the left."
*   **Leg Choice**: You match the base to your light fixtures or chairs.

**Cons:**
*   **Wait Time**: A proper custom table takes 4-8 weeks to flatten, sand, and finish.
*   **Visualization**: You have to trust the maker to envision how the raw gray slab will look once oiled and finished.

## The Kovara Hybrid Model

We try to bridge the gap.
1.  **Inventory**: We keep a massive inventory of **kiln-dried, flattened slabs**. You aren't picking a dirty log in the mud; you are picking a clean, flat slab that just needs final finishing.
2.  **Mockups**: We can tape out the cut lines so you see exactly the shape you will get.

## Which is Cheaper?

Surprisingly, they are often similar in price.
*   **Retail**: You pay for the convenience of it sitting on the floor.
*   **Custom**: You pay for the labor of fabrication.

The real cost difference comes from **shipping**. A custom table made locally in Texas saves you $500-$1000 in freight shipping compared to buying pre-made from a big box store online.
