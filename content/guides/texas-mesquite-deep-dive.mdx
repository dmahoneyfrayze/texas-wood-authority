faq:
  - question: "Why are Mesquite tables so small?"
    answer: "Mesquite trees are scrubby and rarely grow wide or tall. Finding a Mesquite slab over 30 inches wide is extremely rare and very expensive."
  - question: "Does Mesquite move with humidity?"
    answer: "Hardly at all. Mesquite has a nearly 1:1 tangential-to-radial shrinkage ratio, making it the most stable wood in North America."

# Mesquite: Why It's the Most Stable Wood in North America

For many Texans, Mesquite is just something used for BBQ. But for those in the high-end furniture world, it is the holy grail of stability.

## The King of Stability
Most wood expands and contracts significantly as the Texas humidity swings. Mesquite is different. Its cellular structure is so stable that it moves only a fraction of what Oak or Walnut does. 
*   **Benefit**: This means Mesquite is less likely to split, crack, or warp over the decades, even in challenging environments.

## The Aesthetic: Rustic & Rich
Mesquite is not a "clean" wood. It is defined by its character:
*   **Ingrown Bark**: Slabs often have pockets of bark inside the wood.
*   **Cracks & Voids**: Small cracks are part of the Mesquite charm. We typically stabilize these with black epoxy to keep the look natural while making the surface perfectly smooth.
*   **Deep Red Hues**: Over time, Mesquite darkens into a rich, deep reddish-brown that looks incredible under a hand-rubbed oil finish.

## Sizing: The Coffee Table Hero
Because Mesquite trees are relatively small, you almost never see a single-slab Mesquite dining table. 
*   **Coffee Tables**: Mesquite is the absolute best choice for coffee tables and end tables.
*   **River Tables**: If you want a Mesquite dining table, it is almost always made in a "River" style, where multiple smaller boards are joined by epoxy to reach a 40-inch width.

## Sourcing Texas Mesquite
High-quality Mesquite usually comes from South Texas or the Hill Country. It is a slow-growing tree, which is what makes the wood so dense and durable.
