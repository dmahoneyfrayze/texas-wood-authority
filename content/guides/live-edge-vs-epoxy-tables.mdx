faq:
  - question: "Are epoxy tables durable?"
    answer: "High-quality epoxy is very durable and hard. However, it scratches easier than wood and can yellow over time if cheap UV-unstable resins are used."
  - question: "Why are epoxy tables so expensive?"
    answer: "Epoxy resin is expensive (often $100+ per gallon), and building the molds and pouring requires significant additional labor compared to a standard wood table."

# Live Edge vs. Epoxy Tables: What to Know Before Buying

In the world of custom furniture, two styles dominate Instagram feeds: the classic **Natural Live Edge** slab and the modern **Epoxy River Table**.

While both use live edge wood, they are very different animals. This guide compares them head-to-head to help you decide.

## 1. Aesthetic: Nature vs. Art

### Natural Live Edge
*   **The Look**: Timeless, grounded, organic. It highlights the tree exactly as it grew.
*   **Best For**: Traditional homes, rustic cabins, or warming up a sterile modern space.
*   **Trend Factor**: Classics never go out of style.

### Epoxy River Tables
*   **The Look**: Bold, artistic, synthetic contrast. Two live edge slabs are turned inward, with a "river" of colored or clear glass-like resin flowing between them.
*   **Best For**: Modern offices, statement art pieces, "man caves."
*   **Trend Factor**: Very trendy right now. (Risk: It might look "2020s" in a decade).

## 2. Durability and Maintenance

### Wood
*   **Wear**: Wood develops a patina (character) over time. Scratches blend in.
*   **Repair**: Can be sanded and re-oiled easily.

### Epoxy
*   **Wear**: Epoxy is essentially hard plastic. It is very hard, but it shows micro-scratches (swirls) more than wood does.
*   **Heat**: Epoxy can soften under extreme heat (don't put a hot pan directly on it!).
*   **Yellowing**: Cheap epoxy yellows in sunlight. We only use high-grade UV-resistant resins, but physics is physics—UV rays are harsh.

## 3. Cost

*   **Natural Live Edge**: $$$
*   **Epoxy River Table**: $$$$ (Typically 30-50% more expensive)

**Why the cost difference?**
1.  **Material**: Resin costs lots of money by volume.
2.  **Labor**: Building a leak-proof mold, pouring in layers (to prevent overheating), and sanding plastic (which is harder than wood) adds days of labor.

## Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Natural Live Edge If:
*   You want a timeless heirloom.
*   You love the tactile feel of wood grain.
*   You want "warmth" in your room.

### Choose Epoxy If:
*   You want a specific color accent (blue river, black void).
*   You want a perfectly rectangular table but with live edge character inside.
*   You want a piece of "art" that provokes conversation.

## The Hybrid Approach

At Kovara, we often do a hybrid: **Clear Epoxy Filling**.
We take a natural slab and fill the natural cracks/knots with clear resin. This stabilizes the wood and gives a smooth surface without the "plastic river" look. It’s the best of both worlds.
