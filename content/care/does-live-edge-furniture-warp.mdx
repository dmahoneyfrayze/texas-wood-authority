faq:
  - question: "Why does my table have a crack?"
    answer: "Wood adapts to the humidity of your home. Small cracks (checks) can appear in winter when the air is dry."
  - question: "Can I fix a warped table?"
    answer: "Once a thick slab has warped, it is very difficult to flatten without re-milling it (which loses thickness)."

# Does Live Edge Furniture Warp?

The nightmare scenario: You spend thousands on a custom table, and six months later, it looks like a Pringles chip.

Does live edge furniture warp? **It can, if you ignore the science.**

## Why Wood Warps

Wood is hygroscopic—it absorbs and releases moisture from the air like a sponge.
*   **High Humidity**: Cells swell.
*   **Low Humidity**: Cells shrink.

If one side of the board shrinks faster than the other, the board **cups**. If the wood twists along the grain, it **warps**.

## The Defense Strategy

### 1. Kiln Drying (The First Line of Defense)
We cannot stress this enough: **Air dried is not dry enough.**
A slab sitting in a barn for 5 years might be at 12-14% moisture. Your air-conditioned living room is at 6-8%. When that slab enters your home, it will lose that 6% of water rapidly. That rapid loss causes warping.
*   **Our Standard**: We dry to 6-8% in a kiln to "pre-shrink" the wood before substantial fabrication begins.

### 2. The Base Design (The Mechanical Defense)
You cannot stop wood from moving. You can only guide it.
*   **Bad Design**: Screwing a slab directly into a metal frame with simple holes. When the wood tries to shrink, the screws hold it tight, and the wood splits to relieve tension.
*   **Good Design**: Using **slotted holes** or **channels**. This allows the screw to slide left and right as the table expands and contracts, without fighting the wood.

### 3. Finishing Both Sides
If you seal the top of the table with 5 coats of varnish but leave the bottom raw, the bottom will absorb moisture faster than the top. Uneven moisture absorption = warping.
*   **Rule**: We finish the bottom of the table just as thoroughly as the top to ensure balanced airflow.
